  Ingredients
_______________
    1/2 cup butter, softened
    1/2 cup white sugar
    1/2 cup packed brown sugar
    1 egg
    1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
    1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour

    3/4 teaspoon baking soda
    1/2 teaspoon salt
    1 cup milk chocolate chips
    1 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips
    1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk
    1 teaspoon vanilla extract



Directions
___________

    Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
    Sift together flour, baking soda and salt.
    Cream butter and white and brown sugars. Mix in egg and 1/2 teaspoon vanilla. Stir the flour mixture into creamed mixture. Shape the dough into 48 balls, 1 inch each. Place each ball in one compartment of a mini muffin tin.
    For filling, put chocolate chips in a double boiler over simmering water. Stir in milk and vanilla, mix well.
    Bake for 14 to 16 minutes or until lightly browned. Remove from oven and immediately make wells in the center of each using a melon baller. Cool in pan for 5 minutes. Then carefully remove to wire racks. Using a measuring cup fill each shell with the chocolate mixture. Top with a pecan half.
